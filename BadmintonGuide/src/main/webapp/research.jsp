    <center><h2 style="text-decoration:underline;">Let us break down the racket to understand its parts</h2></center><br><br>
    <h3>1)Grip: G1 to G6</h3>
    <h3>2)Weight: U to 5U</h3>
    <h3>3)Head Shape: Oval Shape or Isometric Shape/Square Shape</h3>
    <h3>4)Shaft Flexibility: Flexible, Medium or Stiff</h3>
    <h3>5)Balance: Head Heavy, Balance or Head Light</h3>
    <h3>6)Material: Aluminium, steel, Carbon,Graphite and more</h3>
    <h3>7)String Tension: 18lbs-21lbs, 22lbs-24lbs, 25lbs-28lbs,29lbs-35lbs</h3>
    <center><h2 style="text-decoration: underline">We will explain each of the above items in detail below to help you decide the right racquet</h2></center>
    <ul>
        <h2><li>Grip</li></h2>
    </ul>
    <h2>Most racquets come with a standard grip size of G4. This is found in almost all badminton racquets. G5 grip size is specifically designed for players with small-sized hands while G1/G2 grip size are designed for players with relatively larger-sized hands. Smaller grip sizes will allow for more finger power/wrist action to be used whereas a bigger grip size will utilize more of the arm. There are different ways you can grip your racquet depending on your style of play.</h3><br>
    <table>
        <tr><th>G1</th><th>G2</th><th>G3</th><th>G4</th><th>G5</th><th>G6</th></tr>
        <tr><td>4 inches</td><td>3.75 inches</td><td>3.5 inches</td><td>3.25 inches</td><td>3 inches</td><td>2.75 inches</td></tr>
    </table><br><br>
    <ul>
    <h2><li>Weight</li></h2>
    </ul>
    <h3>Most standard badminton racquets usually weigh between 85-92g(without the string and the grip). A heavy racquet(2U/U) is considered a power racquet while a light racquet(3U) gives better control.</h2>
    <h2>Our recommendation is that Beginners begin with Light weight racquets, lower 'U' means more weight and vice-versa.</h3>
    <h3>The weight of a racquet is classified into few categories, namely:</h3>
    <table>
        <tr><th>5U</th><th>4U</th><th>3U</th><th>2U</th><th>U</th></tr>
        <tr><td>75-79.9g</td><td>80-84.9g</td><td>85-92g</td><td>90-94g</td>
        <td>95-99.9g</td></tr>
    </table><br><br>
    <ul>
        <h2><li>Head Shape</li></h2>
    </ul>
    <h3>Isometric Shaped Racquets have a more squarish head in comparison to an oval racquet. It has a larger sweet spot for beginners to play more effectively. The large sweet spot makes it easier to hit a shot without exerting too much energy.</h3>
    <h3>An oval head Racquet has a smaller sweet spot. It delivers more power if that spot is hit. Oval racquets also provide better control giving the ability to place the shuttle in whatever location you desire. Oval racquets are reccommended for advanced players.</h3><br><br>
    <ul>
        <h2><li>Shaft Flexibility</li></h2>
    </ul>
    <h3>The shaft of a badminton racquet can be flexible or stiff. The shaft is the area between the handle and the strung area of the frame. For beginners, flexible racquets are more suitable as they don't have to exert extra power to play strong shots since less strength is needed</h3>
    <h3>Advantages and Disadvantages of a Flexible Shaft</h3>
    <table>
        <tr><th>Advantage</th><th>Disadvantage</th></tr>
        <tr><td>A flexible shaft will give the player easy access to power without exerting much strength(little energy needed to bend the shaft)</td><td>Less control of shuttle placement since the shaft is easily bent, leading to uncertainity in flight directions of the shuttlecock</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Good for beginners as they can use this to practice on their technique since they won't have to focus on generating enough power for their shots</td><td>Return of shots are slower since the shuttle stays on the string bed for a longer time due to the flex of the shaft</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Can easily defend smashes since you have little time to put strength into your shot</td><td>Low potential for power</td></tr>
    </table><br>

    <table>
        <tr><th>Advantage</th><th>Disadvantage</th></tr>
        <tr><td>Return of shots are faster since the shuttle does not stay on the string bed as long due to stiff flex of the shaft</td>
        <td>A stiff shaft will require a stronger swing and good technique in order to generate power</td></tr>
        <tr><td>More control of shuttle placement since the shaft is stiff and will get instant rebound of the shuttle</td>
        <td>Requires good use of wrist action</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Higher potential power</td><td>More suited to intermediate to advanced players</td></tr>
    </table><br><br>

    <ul>
        <h2><li>Balance</li></h2>
    </ul>
    <h3>Racquet Balance or 'Balance point' refers to the weight distribution of the racquet and is determined by where the centre of balance lies in the racquet, starting from the base of the handle</h3><br>
    <h3>'Head Heavy' racquets feel heavier on the racquet head and yield more power in your smashes.</h3>
    <h3>Head light racquets feel overall lighter and are more maneuverable than 'Head Heavy' racquets. These are well suited for players who play at the nets</h3>
    <h3>Even balanced racquets have an evenly distributed weight across the racquet and gives good feel and flexibility to all-round players</h3>
    <table>
        <tr><th>Balance type</th><th>Player style</th></tr>
        <tr><td>Head Heavy</td><td>For attacking playing style and More power</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Balance</td><td>For both control and maneuverability</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Head light</td><td>For defensive playing style and more speed</td></tr>
    </table><br><br>

    <ul>
        <h2><li>Material</li></h2>
    </ul>
    <h3>Badminton racquets are made up off different types of materials. Example: Wood, Steel, Carbon Fiber, Aluminium, Graphite etc. Steel and Aluminium racquets are reccommended for begginers.</h3>
    <table>
        <tr><th>Balance type</th><th>Player style</th></tr>
        <tr><td>Beginners</td><td>Steel/Aluminium</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Intermediates</td><td>Steel/Aluminium/Carbon Fiber</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Proffessionals</td><td>Graphite</td></tr>
    </table><br><br>
    
    <ul>
        <h2><li>String Tension</li></h2>
    </ul>
    <h3>As the string tension increases, the sweet spot reduces and becomes more concentrated. Below table gives the ideal string tension for various playing levels.</h3>
    <table>
        <tr><th>String Tension</th><th>Playing Level</th></tr>
        <tr><td>18-21lbs</td><td>Beginners</td></tr>
        <tr><td>22-24lbs</td><td>Intermediates</td></tr>
        <tr><td>25-28lbs</td><td>Advanced Players</td></tr>
        <tr><td>29-35lbs</td><td>Country/Proffessional players</td></tr>
    </table>
